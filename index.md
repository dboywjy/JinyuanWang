  <!-- Welcome! This site serves as an example for the Bay Jekyll theme. Bay is a very simple and minimal theme, directly inspired by Dan Grover's <a href="http://dangrover.com">website</a>. -->
Welcome! This is my personal site. I am currently a Master student of Financial Mathematics <a href="https://mafm.hkust.edu.hk/">(MAFM)</a> at HKUST. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Shanghai Tongji University in 2021. After that, I worked as a quantitative risk analyst in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. I am interested in Mathematics, Statistics, Machine Learning, Financial Engineering and looking for opportunities to gain more experience and insights in related fields.
